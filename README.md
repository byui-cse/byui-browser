# byui-browser

The BYU-Idaho browser developed by the CSE 199R and CSE 399R classes.

An independent web browser built from scratch in Rust. See
[`docs/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md) for architecture,
crate ownership, and collaboration rules. Team overviews live in
[`docs/TEAMS.md`](docs/TEAMS.md).

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable (1.85+, edition 2024)

```bash
rustup update stable
```

## Build & test

```bash
make build                 # build the workspace (debug)
make test                  # unit tests across the workspace
make test html             # tests for a single crate
make lint                  # rustfmt check + clippy (-D warnings)
make release linux         # release build for macos | linux | windows
```

The binary entry point:

```bash
cargo run -p browser
```

## Development workflow

- Trunk-based development on `main`
- Feature branches: `team/short-description` (e.g. `css/cascade-layers`)
- Before merge: `make lint` and `make test` (or `make test <crate>` for changed crates)
- Cross-crate / `common` changes need review from affected owning teams
- Record architecture decisions in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/)

## Status

Scaffolding only. Crates compile and declare ownership boundaries; engine
behavior is intentionally unimplemented so teams can fill in their crates.
